### About Me

I'm a post-grad student in informatics with a background in economics. I've been into programming for the last 5 years, mostly as a hobby. While I haven't worked on any big real-world projects yet, I've done a bunch of assignments of different sizes. I pick up new things quickly and have a good understanding of programming and computer science in general.
