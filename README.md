### About Me

Hey! I'm a post-grad student in informatics with a background in economics. I've been into programming for the last 5 years, mostly as a hobby. While I haven't worked on any big real-world projects yet, I've done a bunch of assignments of different sizes. I pick up new things quickly and have a good understanding of programming and computer science in general.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- My MSc thesis: building a custom 2D game graphics engine from scratch using C++.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- Advanced graphics programming.
- How to optimize game engines.
- New tech and frameworks in game development.

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
- Open source game development projects.
- Cool projects that push the limits of graphics and interactivity.

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with
- Feedback on my 2D game graphics engine.
- Tips on optimizing C++ code for games.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
- C++ programming.
- Game development.
- How economics and informatics can mix.
